# About CDM-IFC

The [Conceptual Data Model](https://github.com/UICrail/CDM-MOTIONAL/wiki/01-%E2%80%90-What-is-the-CDM%3F) (CDM) is a federation of models. Since the Shift2Rail LinX4Rail project (see public deliverable D8.3, 2023), IFC is an integral part of the Conceptual Data Model within the FP1-MOTIONAL project (see [CDM-MOTIONAL](https://github.com/UICrail/CDM-MOTIONAL) for more details). IFC is and remains the property of buildingSmart International, and is under the full control of bSI. 

IFC is natively expressed in [EXPRESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXPRESS_(data_modeling_language)), a rich but not-so-widespread formal language; see ISO10303 and [the EXPRESS specification by OMG](https://www.omg.org/spec/EXPRESS/). IFC has an equivalent representation in RDF/OWL: see [these technical explanations](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/ifc/ifc-formats/ifcowl/).

IFC releases (in various formats) are available on [this bSI page](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/ifc/ifc-schema-specifications/). The IfcOWL version is not downloadable directly; see the Wiki for links.

The present repository hosts some general __explanations about the usage of IFC in the context of the CDM: see the [Wiki](https://github.com/UICrail/CDM-IFC/wiki)__. Also, adapter vocabularies are proposed: these are small ontologies allowing smooth linkage of some particularly relevant IFC classes and properties with the rest of the CDM).
