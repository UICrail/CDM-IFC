# About CDM-IFC

The CDM (Conceptual Data Model) is a federation of models. Since the Shift2Rail LinX4Rail project, IFC is an integral part of the CDM. IFC is and remains the property of buildingSmart International, and is under the full control of bSI.

An RDF/OWL representation of IFC 4.0 ADD2 is available on the bSI IFC website. CDM however needs IFC Rail extensions that are released under IFC 4.3 ADD2. The updated RDF/OWL representation of IFC is not yet public.

The present repository hosts some general __explanations about the usage of IFC in the context of the CDM: see the Wiki__. Also, adapter vocabularies are proposed: these are small ontologies allowing smooth linkage of some particularly relevant IFC classes and properties with the rest of the CDM).
